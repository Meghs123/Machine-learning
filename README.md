# Machine-learning

#Apparel Product Recommendation System
- Applied Natural Language Feature Engineering and built a content based recommendation system using NLP Models (Bag
of words and TF-IDF) in problem of recommending similar products on e- commerce websites by using Amazon product
advertising API. Tech Stack - Python, BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, NLP.

Face Recognition System
- Applied K Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm in face recognition using opencv and HaarCascades CNN.
Model for frontal face detection. Tech Stack - Python, ML(KNN), OpenCV.

Handwritten Digit Recognition
- Applied K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm in recognizing handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the MNIST dataset.
- Developed a system from scratch which includes a machine to understand and classify the images of handwritten digits as
10 digits (0–9). Accuracy of the model was around 98%. Tech Stack - Python, ML(KNN), OpenCV, MNIST Database.

Dominant Color Extraction
- Applied K Means Clustering Unsupervised Algorithm in Segmenting an image into set ok K Dominant Colors.
- Extracted the K Dominant Colors from the image and then re-colorized it using those K Colors. Tech Stack - Python, ML(KMeans), OpenCV.

Word Analogies
- Solving Word Analogies by representing Words as Vectors using Google Pretrained Deep Learning Model, Word2Vec
- Trained the Word2Vec model using Gensim’s implementation of Word2Vec. Used Gensim, a python toolkit which helps
with vector-space and topic modeling to create a model that solved analogies. Tech Stack - Python, Word2Vec.

Air Quality Prediction
- Predicted Pollution Levels by building linear regression model, designed a machine learning model which can predict the
air quality index. Tech Stack :- Python, ML (Linear Regression)
